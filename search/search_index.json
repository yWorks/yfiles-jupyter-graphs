To be used in jupyter-notebook or jupyter-lab. Example from yfiles_jupyter_graphs import GraphWidget w = GraphWidget() w.show() See notebooks for more examples. Notes Nodes and edges properties should be constructed recursively with basic python types otherwise {de-}serializers will fail. Properties nodes: typing.List[typing.Dict] Data structure. def get_nodes() Getter for the nodes traitlets property. Notes This function acts as an alias for using GraphWidget.nodes property e.g. w.nodes == w.get_nodes() . Returns Name Type Description nodes typing.List[typing.Dict] Each node has the keys id: int and properties: typing.Dict . It might include keys that are not set directly, see (default) node mappings for details. def set_nodes(nodes) Setter for the nodes traitlets property. Parameters Name Type Description nodes typing.List[typing.Dict] Each node should have the keys id: int and properties: typing.Dict . Properties should be constructed recursively with basic python types, otherwise {de-}serializers will fail. Example In [1]: from yfiles_jupyter_graphs import GraphWidget In [2]: w = GraphWidget() In [3]: w.set_nodes([ {'id': 0, 'properties': {'label': 'Hello World'}}, {'id': 1, 'properties': {'label': 'This is a second node.'}} ]) Notes This function acts as an alias for using GraphWidget.nodes property e.g. w.nodes = [{...}] has the same effect as using w.set_nodes([{...}]) . edges: typing.List[typing.Dict] Data structure. def get_edges() Getter for the edges traitlets property. Notes This function acts as an alias for using GraphWidget.edges property e.g. w.edges == w.get_edges() is true . Returns Name Type Description edges typing.List[typing.Dict] Each edge has the keys id: int , start: int , end: int and properties: typing.Dict . It might include keys that are not set directly, see (default) edge mappings for details. def set_edges(edges) Setter for the edges traitlets property. Parameters Name Type Description edges typing.List[typing.Dict] Each edge should have the keys id: int , start: int , end:int and properties: typing.Dict . Ids for start and end should be among used node ids, otherwise the edge does not appear. Properties should be constructed recursively with basic python types, otherwise {de-}serializers will fail. Example In [1]: from yfiles_jupyter_graphs import GraphWidget In [2]: w = GraphWidget() In [3]: w.set_edges([ {'id': 0, 'start': 0, 'end': 1, 'properties': {'label': 'edge between first and second node'}} ]) Notes This function acts as an alias for using GraphWidget.edges property e.g. w.edges = [{...}] has the same effect as using w.set_edges([{...}]) . def get_selection() Returns the nodes and edges, that are selected in the displayed widget. Returns Name Type Description nodes typing.List[typing.Dict] List of selected nodes. edges typing.List[typing.Dict] List of selected edges. directed: bool Graph wide flag for edge type. def get_directed() Getter for the directed traitlets property. Notes This function acts as an alias for using GraphWidget.directed property e.g. w.directed == w.get_directed() is true . Returns Name Type Description directed bool Whether the graph is interpreted as directed. def set_directed(directed) Setter for the directed traitlets property. Parameters Name Type Description directed bool Whether the graph is interpreted as directed. Notes This function acts as an alias for using GraphWidget.directed property e.g. w.directed = x has the same effect as using w.set_directed(x) . graph_layout: typing.Dict Choose an algorithm for positioning nodes and/or edges. def get_graph_layout() Getter for the graph layout traitlet property. Notes This function acts as an alias for using GraphWidget.graph_layout property e.g. w.graph_layout == w.get_graph_layout() is true . Returns Name Type Description graph_layout typing.Dict Returned dict has keys algorithm: str and options: dict, however options are empty because the algorithms use default settings from yFiles library. def set_graph_layout(algorithm) Choose graph layout. Currently the algorithms use default settings from yFiles library. Parameters Name Type Description algorithm str Specify graph layout (or edge router) algorithm. Available algorithms are: [\"circular\", \"hierarchic\", \"organic\", \"orthogonal\", \"radial\", \"tree\", \"orthogonal_edge_router\", \"organic_edge_router\"] Notes This function acts as an alias for using GraphWidget.graph_layout property e.g. w.graph_layout = 'organic' has the same effect as using w.set_graph_layout('organic') . Setting w.graph_layout = {'algorithm': 'organic', 'options': {}} works as well, which corresponds to using value given through the associated getter. In case you want to use the edge routers you should set a custom node position mapping as well. See yFiles docs for more details about the algorithms. neighborhood: typing.Dict Control neighborhood view component. def get_neighborhood() Getter for the neighborhood traitlets property. Returns Name Type Description neighborhood typing.Dict Returned dict has keys max_distance: int and selected_nodes: list, a list of node ids. def set_neighborhood(max_distance, selected_nodes) Specify the neighborhood view in the widget.

If there are multiple paths to one (or multiple) selected nodes, the smallest path length is considered for this threshold. selected_nodes typing.List (optional) Choose a list of node ids that are highlighted in both main and neighborhood component. They act as starting points for neighborhood calculation. Notes This function acts as an alias for using GraphWidget.neighborhood property. You can assign values by w.neighborhood = {'max_distance': 2, 'selected_nodes':[2]} or w.set_neighborhood(2, [2]) , both are equivalent. The short form w.neighborhood = 3 sets only the max_distance variable and resets the selected nodes. sidebar: typing.Dict Control sidebar component. def get_sidebar() Getter for the sidebar traitlets property. Returns Name Type Description sidebar typing.Dict Returned dict has keys enabled: bool and start_with: str, whereat first one indicates open or closed sidebar and second one indicates start panel on widget show. def set_sidebar(enabled, start_with) Specify the appearance of the sidebar in the widget. Can be used to collapse sidebar or start with any panel. Parameters Name Type Description enabled bool Whether to open or collapse sidebar at widget startup. start_with str The start panel identifier. Available are 'Neighborhood', 'Data', 'Search' and 'About' (the default). Notes This function acts as an alias for using GraphWidget.sidebar property. You can assign values by w.sidebar = {'enabled': True, 'start_with': 'Search'} or w.set_sidebar(True, 'Search') , both are equivalent. The short form w.sidebar = True sets only the enabled variable and resets the start_with back to the default. overview: bool Control overview component. def get_overview() Getter for the overview traitlets property. Returns Name Type Description overview bool Indicates open or closed overview state. A value of None means that a specific behaviour based on widget layout is followed. def set_overview(enabled) Specify the appearance of the overview component in the widget.

Methods def init (widget_layout = None, overview_enabled = None, context_start_with = '') GraphWidget constructor. Parameters Name Type Description widget_layout ipywidgets.Layout (optional) Can be used to specify general widget appearance through css attributes.

Use None to start with closed sidebar. Available are Neighborhood , Data , Search and About . def show() Display widget in Jupyter. Same as using single object reference in cell directly. Notes Mappings will only be applied shortly before showing the widget. def import_graph(graph) Import a graph object defined in an external module. Sets the nodes , edges and directed traitlets properties with information extracted from the graph object. See graph importers for object specific transformation details.
