## Unknown domains

If your domain is unknown to the widget, you will see a popup in the widget that states that it runs on an unknown
domain.

The widget's popup provides a button with which you can temporarily continue using yFiles Graphs for Jupyter.

If you think the widget should also be allow-listed on the domain you are running it on, or if you need a specific
activation license for your domain, please get in touch with us 
by [email](mailto:contact@yworks.com?subject=yFiles%20Graphs%20For%20Jupyter%20-%20Domain%20license%20request) or 
on [GitHub](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-jupyter-graphs/discussions/).

## Obtaining a domain specific license 

Please get in touch with us 
by [email](mailto:contact@yworks.com?subject=yFiles%20Graphs%20For%20Jupyter%20-%20Domain%20license%20request) if 
you require a specific activation key for your domain.

## Using a license Key

To use a specific activation license, set `GraphWidget.license`

```python
from yfiles_jupyter_graphs import GraphWidget
GraphWidget.license = {
  "id": "6440496d-b481-49a5-a824-78d591e590b4",
  "domains": [
    "my.domain.com"
  ],
  "expiry": "2024-01-05",
  "version": "1.0",
  "signature": "8214787cc5f7e2bf25f4a25e43f9d7e9d482c..."
}
```

or provide it as `license` parameter to the `GraphWidget` constructor:

```python
w = GraphWidget(license={
  "id": "6440496d-b481-49a5-a824-78d591e590b4",
  "domains": [
    "my.domain.com"
  ],
  "expiry": "2024-01-05",
  "version": "1.0",
  "signature": "8214787cc5f7e2bf25f4a25e43f9d7e9d482c..."
})
```

The license is stored statically on `GraphWidget` in both cases. Therefore, you only need to specify it once on the 
imported `GraphWidget`.
